# Description
The VJC Bear, Bobby, has been a mascot for the junior college for decades. It embodies the vigour, tenacity and mannerisms of Victorians. This project was started to enable the older generations, primarily more familiar with Whatsapp(than other platforms such as Telegram), to express themselves through the use of our school's mascot stickers.

Unlike Telegram, whatsapp regulates all sticker packs. All sticker packs must be authenticated through an android app. Kinda smart imo cuz Google Play check for inappropriate content, so doing so saves fb time to manually filter thru the stickers. 

This was my virgin attempt at using Android Studio in Jan 2019. I made use of a repo, please see below for original readme from source <br/>

# WhatsApp Stickers

If you'd like to create your own stickers for WhatsApp, you can package them in an Android or iOS app. You can publish your sticker app like any other app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, and users who download and install your app will be able to start sending those stickers right away from within WhatsApp. Stickers on WhatsApp must be legal, authorized and acceptable. Learn more about acceptable uses of our services from our [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service).

To get started, review the `README` files in the [Android](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/Android) or [iOS](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/iOS) folders, and refer to the FAQ at https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000226.
